This program is used to copy text files.

To copy a file follow the instructions:
1. "gcc -Wall -o filecopy filecopy.c"
2. "./filecopy source_file.txt destination_file.txt"
3. Follow the onscreen prompts

The algorithm of the code can be shown as:
1. Acquire the input and oytput file name
2. Read input file
3. Check if output file exists and deal with the situation accordingly
4. Write in the output file until read fails
5. Close output and input files
6. Termination
